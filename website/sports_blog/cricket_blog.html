                        <blockquote>‘The Gentleman’s Game’</blockquote> as it has been called, made its way into the commonwealth countries like the nations in the Indian Subcontinent, the Caribbean Islands, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries. As a game requiring strict adherence to some rules, it pictured quite a contrast with the sport of baseball, a game requiring a similar skill set.
                        <br>
                        One of the important things which separate the game of cricket apart from baseball is the variety of shots being played in cricket. The cover drives, straight drive, pull shot, on-drive and square-cut are just a few in the wide arsenal of cricketing shots. Playing each cricketing shot requires a lot of determination, practice and perseverance on the part of the batsman.

                    <p> Amidst all the chaos and commotion surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, the Vincy Premier T10 League (VPL) is scheduled to get underway on Thursday, May 21 with the final to take place on Sunday, May 31. It’s a six-team tournament organized by St Vincent and Grenadines Cricket Association (SVGCA) and the matches would be played at the Arnos Valley Sporting Complex.
                        <br>
                        72 players were drafted in and the teams were named after the tourist spots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Since the COVID-19 halted cricket, it will be for the first time when international cricketers will be in action. Kesrick Williams, Sunil Ambris and Obed McCoy will be plying their trade. Keron Cottoy, who was a part of St Kitts and Nevis Patriots in CPL 2019, is also a part of the event.

                    <p> Test cricket is the purest form of cricket. A packed-house MCG on a boxing day Test is proof that it hasn’t lost the relevance even after more than a hundred years of its existence. Over the years, the number of nations who would play Test cricket has increased. Initially, there were only Australia and England, who were followed by the West Indies and South Africa.
                        <br>
                        New Zealand, India and Pakistan were the next three years to be inducted into Test cricket. With the birth of One-day cricket, countries like Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and later Bangladesh also got Test status. It was only in 2018, that Afghanistan and Ireland made their Test debuts making the 12-nation structure followed in Test cricket since. At Crictracker, we came up with a unique all-time Test XI with one cricketer from each country.

                    <p> The use of technology has given an extra layer of protection to the players on the field. The ability to challenge an umpire decision is probably one of the best things that have happened to the sport. After years of players criticising umpires for adjudging them out wrongly, the Decision Review System or DRS has opened up a platform where players can actually check if they are not satisfied with the decision from the umpire.
                        <br>
                        However, players have not always been able to use DRS properly. It is quite difficult for a player to discuss it with their teammates properly within 15 seconds and then go for the review. This has sometimes created a situation where the players have asked for a very stupid review.

                    <p> Cricketers and Film Stars occupy a special place in the hearts of Indians as they receive godly treatment for their contributions in respective fields. The celebrities came forward together on many occasions for a cause. One of the rarest of instances was recorded in September 2003 when the actors of the Telugu film industry (Tollywood) joined hands with the Indian cricket team for being part of a Celebrity Charity Cricket match.
                        <br>
                        Big names from the Indian team at that time played alongside top Telugu stars to raise funds to cricket in Andhra Pradesh. Indian didn’t have any International commitments after being part of the Bangladesh Tri-series in April. India played the tournament straight after they finished as the runners-up during the World Cup hosted by Africa. Earlier in February, a one-day tournament was held featuring Telugu actors which turned out to be a successful venture for broadcaster ‘MAA’ TV.
