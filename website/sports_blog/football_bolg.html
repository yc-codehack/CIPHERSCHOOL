                    <p style="padding-left: 30%;"> Liverpool and Manchester United resumed group training on Wednesday as the Premier League moves a step closer to a return.
                        <br>
                        Premier League clubs were given the green light to begin 'phase one' training in small groups on Tuesday after testing revealed only six positive cases of coronavirus from 748 tests carried out on players and non-playing staff.
                        <br>
                        Chelsea, Newcastle and West Ham were among the clubs to return on Tuesday under strict social distancing measures, while Liverpool resumed group training at Melwood on Wednesday after manager Jurgen Klopp gave his backing to the Premier League's Project Restart.

                    <p style="padding-left: 30%;"> Inter Milan want to sign Edinson Cavani on a free transfer this summer as they prepare for the potential departure of Lautaro Martinez to Barcelona, according to Sky in Italy.
                        <br>
                        Cavani is out of contract at Paris Saint-Germain this summer - so is free to speak to other clubs - and he has also been a target for Atletico Madrid since January, as well as clubs in the Premier League.
                        <br>
                        Inter are exploring possible free transfers and swap deals, with the summer transfer market expected to be heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and they are also keen on Brescia's Sandro Tonali.

                    <p style="padding-left: 30%;"> Celtic's achievement in winning a ninth straight title should lose no credit because of the season's early end, ex-striker John Harton told The Football Show.
                        <br>
                        Hartson, who played 146 times for the Bhoys and scored 88 goals, paid tribute to the club's "wonderful achievement" in lifting a joint-record ninth consecutive top-flight league title.
                        <br>
                        Celtic were awarded the trophy after a meeting of SPFL clubs on Monday curtailed the season early, with the club holding a 13-point lead over nearest rivals Rangers - a far cry from the turn of the year when Steven Gerrard's side trailed by only two points with a game in hand.
