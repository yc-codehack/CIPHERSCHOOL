                    <p style="padding-left: 30%;"> He showed little mercy when berating co-workers.He seized on their setbacks and scoffed at their maladies. He punched at least two in the head.
                        <br>
                        The office etiquette in question did not belong to a swashbuckling bond trader or adrenaline- addled bouncer. It belonged to Michael Jordan, a six-time National Basketball Association champion and pop-culture icon widely regarded as the game’s best player ever.
                        <br>
                        As Jordan himself said of his teammates in “The Last Dance,” the 10-part documentary about his career whose last two episodes will be shown Sunday night: 
                        <br>
                        “I’m going to ridicule you until you get on the same level as me. And if you don’t get on the same level, then it’s going to be hell for you.”
                        <br>
                        More than 15 years after Jordan retired from professional basketball — for the third time — the mix of power and grace he displayed on the court remains a breathless.

                        <br>
                        Owners and executives were said to be encouraged about the league's steps toward returning safely amid the coronavirus pandemic and that talks with the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) went well.
                        <br>
                        It was emphasised that in order for a return to occur, all parties would need to accept that a single positive test for Covid-19 would not derail the season.Silver reportedly said if a positive test would "shut us down, we probably should not go down this path".

                        <br>
                        CCTV, which holds exclusive TV rights for the NBA, has not aired any of the popular league's games since a Houston Rockets executive tweeted support for Hong Kong protesters last year."China Central Television refutes rumours that it would restore streaming NBA games, reiterating its consistent stance on national sovereignty," the Global Times said on Twitter.
                        <br>
                        Rockets general manager Daryl Morey had tweeted in support of the protests in Hong Kong, a Chinese-ruled city embroiled in a political crisis due to months of anti-government protests stemming from a controversial extradition Bill.

                    <p style="padding-left: 30%;"> Kobe Bryant  was a five-time National Basketball Association champion who retired in 2016 before adding an Academy award to his considerable trophy case two years later. In sports and in life, Bryant, who has been killed in a helicopter crash the age of 41, was an individual whose tirelessness and competitive drive were as notable as his versatility and ambition.
                        <br>
                        Bryant was one of the smoothest and most dangerous shooters in a league previously dominated by Jordan, Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Larry Bird. When those players retired or their talents faded, Bryant took up their mantle. The 6ft 6in shooting guard was named to the NBA‘s all-star team in 18 of his 20 seasons, all with the Lakers, and he twice led the league in scoring. He scored 81 points during a game in 2006, the second-highest total in a game in league history.

                        On Friday, New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson became the latest NBA star to announce he would be donating thousands of dollars to cover the hourly wages of employees.

                        “The people of New Orleans have been incredibly welcoming and supportive since I was drafted by the Pels last June, and some of the most special people I have met are those who work at smoothie King Centre,”
